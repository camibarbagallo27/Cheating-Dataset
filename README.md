# Cheating-Dataset
Creating a dataset from which we could possibly create a model to detect cheating in online exams. 

To do this we used some commands from the powershell in windows computers to get information about the processes running in the computer. We then created 2 benchmarks of no-cheating and compared all cases through PSI and Chi-Square tests. We concluded this is not a good way of detecting cheating.

This project was done by Camila Barbagallo, Ryan Daher, Paula García and Rocío González Lantero.
